# Quantum-Essentials
Quantum Essentials is an essentials like plugin, which features a variety of useful features for all kinds of servers. My goal with this plugin was to try and recreate essentials, but in my own way. This was mainly made to be a useful plugin to use on minecraft servers for my friends, and to have some fun coding.
